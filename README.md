________________________________

A simple CSS and JS based codes to manage your essential URL links. Code sample shows news links. 

Hightlights:
 
- Use tabs to categorize the URL links. You can add as many tabs you like.

- Rotate the background color or image of the tab with a single click. Web page won't reload when changing background color or background image.

- Also toggle background styles. In the example code, we toggle between background color and background image styles.

- Cookies are used to keep track current page tab, background color, background picture, or background style choice.

- Show host name, current date and time tick.
